# Open Source Articles
This project serves to solve problems in journalism by allowing people to write stories as if they would write open source software. For too long shadow edits on articles and lack of transparency about the backend functionality of modern CMS systems has allowed journalists to stealth edit articles. This preventss us from understanding how often corporate media is forced to correct themselves. This project uses the power of Git to provide a rich historical timeline of articles by allowing all readers to view edits, and view who edited the piece. All articles go through strict community approval. We have a panel of trusted individuals that act as editors in chief that are authorized to approve Pull Requests for certain categories.
